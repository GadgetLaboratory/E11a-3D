Hey, Larry here.

So, uh... pretty nick of time, eh?
Something tells me I'm not catching up all the way, by now.  But I'm at least gonna get into the C ranking, and hey, considering I didn't have a laptop this year?  I think that's not half bad.

But anyway.  Here, I did the exercise and the thing.  Only now have I started to learn how this program really has begun to work, and if I have ANY measure of time left at all, I think this will be a big help to my Breakout project.  Thing is... I don't think I have much time left, what with another paper in another class creeping ever closer.  I can only hope that I finish that project fast enough to be able to make a difference.
